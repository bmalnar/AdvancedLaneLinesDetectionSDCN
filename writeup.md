# **Advanced Lane Lines Detection Project**
## Writeup / README

This is a summary of the work done to develop a processing pipeline for the advanced lane lines detection project for the Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree. The github repositroy of the project can be found [here] (https://github.com/bmalnar/AdvancedLaneLinesDetectionSDCN)

The steps described in the following text include:

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

### Camera Calibration

The code for camera calibration can be found in the jupyter notebook, cells 2 through 6. The method is based on the OpenCV functions for camera calibration, as described in the following text. 
The camera calibration images are provided in the Udacity repository for the project, and are stored in the directory called `camera_cal`. There are 20 images provided, and the goal is to use most of them (ideally all) for the calibration. The code does the following: 

1) Create `objpoints` and `imgpoints` arrays that will store the detected corners and the corresponding image points for all of the images. 
2) For each image, get the corners and the corresponding image points, and add those to the global arrays created in step 1. Some images have 9x6 corners and some have 9x5, so we have to make sure that we try both options with the function `cv2.findChessboardCorners`. There are two images that don't correspond to any of these 2 dimensions and they are ignored, so overall 18 images are used for calibration. 
3) Use the function `cv2.calibrateCamera` to calculate the camera matrix, distortion coefficients, and rotation and translation vectors, based on `objpoints` and `imgpoints`. The camera matrix and the distortion coefficients are later used in the image processing pipeline. 

To verify that the calibration produced good results, we can undistort one of the images from the camera_cal directory:

<img src="camera_cal/calibration5.jpg" width="480" alt="Original image" />

By running the command `cv2.undistort` to undistort the image, we get: 

<img src="output_images/calibration_5_calibrated.jpg" width="480" alt="Undistorted image" />



### Pipeline (single images)

#### 1. Provide an example of a distortion-corrected image.

To demonstrate this step, I will describe how I apply the distortion correction to one of the test images like this one:

#### 2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you used color transforms, gradients or other methods to create a thresholded binary image.  Provide an example of a binary image result.

I used a combination of color and gradient thresholds to generate a binary image (thresholding steps at lines # through # in `another_file.py`).  Here's an example of my output for this step.  (note: this is not actually from one of the test images)

#### 3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you performed a perspective transform and provide an example of a transformed image.

The code for my perspective transform includes a function called `warper()`, which appears in lines 1 through 8 in the file `example.py` (output_images/examples/example.py) (or, for example, in the 3rd code cell of the IPython notebook).  The `warper()` function takes as inputs an image (`img`), as well as source (`src`) and destination (`dst`) points.  I chose the hardcode the source and destination points in the following manner:

```python
src = np.float32(
    [[(img_size[0] / 2) - 55, img_size[1] / 2 + 100],
    [((img_size[0] / 6) - 10), img_size[1]],
    [(img_size[0] * 5 / 6) + 60, img_size[1]],
    [(img_size[0] / 2 + 55), img_size[1] / 2 + 100]])
dst = np.float32(
    [[(img_size[0] / 4), 0],
    [(img_size[0] / 4), img_size[1]],
    [(img_size[0] * 3 / 4), img_size[1]],
    [(img_size[0] * 3 / 4), 0]])
```

This resulted in the following source and destination points:

| Source        | Destination   | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:| 
| 585, 460      | 320, 0        | 
| 203, 720      | 320, 720      |
| 1127, 720     | 960, 720      |
| 695, 460      | 960, 0        |

I verified that my perspective transform was working as expected by drawing the `src` and `dst` points onto a test image and its warped counterpart to verify that the lines appear parallel in the warped image.

#### 4. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you identified lane-line pixels and fit their positions with a polynomial?

Then I did some other stuff and fit my lane lines with a 2nd order polynomial kinda like this:

#### 5. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you calculated the radius of curvature of the lane and the position of the vehicle with respect to center.

I did this in lines # through # in my code in `my_other_file.py`

#### 6. Provide an example image of your result plotted back down onto the road such that the lane area is identified clearly.

I implemented this step in lines # through # in my code in `yet_another_file.py` in the function `map_lane()`.  Here is an example of my result on a test image:

### Pipeline (video)

#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (wobbly lines are ok but no catastrophic failures that would cause the car to drive off the road!).

Here's a [link to my video result](./project_video.mp4)

### Discussion

#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

Here I'll talk about the approach I took, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the pipeline might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.
